My own examples of some of the design patterns

<em>Design Patterns</em> are used to make your code more flexible and maintainable and are general solutions to common problems.
A pattern is a guideline for flexible and resilient code design.

#Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

#Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of it's dependents are notified and updated automaticly. (This pattern is one of the most commonly used patterns)
